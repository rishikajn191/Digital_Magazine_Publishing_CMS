# Digital_Magazine_Publishing_CMS

## Overview
This project implements a complete backend **Content Management System (CMS)** for publishing digital magazines using **only MySQL**. It manages magazines, articles, media, authors, categories, and user roles, and supports workflows and content analytics.

Designed as part of the **DevifyX Assignment**, this project is implemented entirely through SQL scripts including schema definition, data insertion, stored procedures, triggers, views, and events.

## Setup Instructions
### STEP 1: Set Up MySQL Environment
You can use:
- MySQL Workbench (GUI)
- Terminal/Command Line with mysql
- XAMPP/LAMP/MAMP stack
- VS Code with MySQL extension
  
### STEP 2: Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE digital_magazine_cms;
USE digital_magazine_cms;
```
### STEP 3: Run SQL Scripts
#### 1. Schema Setup (**schema.sql**)
This script defines the database structure:
- Users, Roles
- Articles, Magazines, Authors
- Media, Tags, Comments
- AuditTrail and Stats tables
#### 2. Insert Sample Data (**sample_data.sql**)
Populates the database with:
- Sample magazines, articles, authors
- Tags, media, comments
- Users with roles like **admin**, **author**, etc.
Also includes pre-configured triggers (e.g., for auditing article status)
#### 3. Procedures, Views & Events (**procedures_views.sql**)
Implements:
- Stored Procedures like **PublishArticle**
- Triggers to track article status changes
- Views like **PublishedArticlesSummary**
- Scheduled Events to auto-publish articles

#### Run scripts in this order:
```sql
SOURCE schema.sql;
SOURCE sample_data.sql;
SOURCE procedures_views.sql;
```
### STEP 4: Enable Event Scheduler (Required for Scheduled Publishing)
```sql
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```
**Note:** This step is necessary for MySQL to execute scheduled events (like auto-publishing).
### Step 4: Try Core Functionalities 
- Publish an Article
```sql
CALL PublishArticle(2, 1);
```
Publishes article with ID 2 and logs it under user ID 1 (admin).
- Perform Full-Text Search
```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles WHERE MATCH(title, content) AGAINST ('Quantum' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```
Searches articles for keywords like ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù.
- View All Published Articles
```sql
SELECT * FROM PublishedArticlesSummary;
```
See article title, author, magazine, category for published articles.
- Check Article Comments
```sql
SELECT * FROM CommentDetails;
```
View comments with article titles and usernames, including moderation status.
### Step 5: Test Automatic Publishing
To test scheduled publishing:
- Insert an article with:
1. status = 'draft' <BR>
2. scheduled_date set in the near future (e.g., NOW() + INTERVAL 1 MINUTE)
- Wait and re-run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Articles WHERE status = 'published';
```
The scheduled event will automatically publish it if the date has passed.
### Step 6: Optional Enhancements
You can implement and test:
- Additional procedures: **AddComment()**, **AssignAuthor()**
- More views: **AuthorWiseArticles**, **MonthlyArticleStats**
- Complex triggers: Track media additions or deletions
- Analytics queries: Top-viewed articles, category-wise count
